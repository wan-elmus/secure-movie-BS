      <section class="overview">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          The Secure Movie Blog is a web-based platform that allows users to share and explore movie reviews and discussions. The aim of this project is to develop a secure, usable, and accessible movie blog system that prioritizes user privacy and protects against common security vulnerabilities.
        </p>

      <section class="security-measures">
        <h2>Security Measures</h2>
        <h3>Account Enumeration</h3>
        <p>
          To defend against account enumeration attacks, the system implements a consistent error message for both existing and non-existing user accounts during the login process. This prevents attackers from identifying valid usernames through error messages.
        </p>

        <h3>Session Hijacking</h3>
        <p>
          The system utilizes secure session management techniques to prevent session hijacking attacks. Session tokens are generated securely and stored in HttpOnly cookies, making it difficult for attackers to steal active sessions.
        </p>

        <h3>SQL Injection</h3>
        <p>
          To mitigate SQL injection vulnerabilities, the system employs parameterized queries when interacting with the MySQL database. This prevents malicious SQL code from being executed and ensures data integrity.
        </p>

        <h3>Cross-site Scripting (XSS)</h3>
        <p>
          To protect against cross-site scripting attacks, the system sanitizes and validates user inputs before displaying them in web pages. This prevents the execution of malicious scripts injected by attackers.
        </p>

        <h3>Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF)</h3>
        <p>
          The system includes CSRF tokens in forms and requests to prevent cross-site request forgery attacks. This ensures that requests originate from legitimate sources, mitigating potential unauthorized actions.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="authentication">
        <h2>User Authentication and 2FA</h2>
        <p>
          User authentication is reinforced with robust hashing and salting techniques to store user passwords securely. Additionally, the system supports two-factor authentication (2FA) using One-Time Passwords (OTPs) sent via email. This enhances the overall security of user accounts.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="usability-accessibility">
        <h2>Usability and Accessibility</h2>
        <p>
          While prioritizing security, the Secure Movie Blog also focuses on usability and accessibility. The user interface is designed to be intuitive, making it easy for users to navigate and interact with the platform. Accessibility features, such as keyboard navigation and descriptive alt tags for images, are implemented to ensure inclusivity for all users.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="trade-offs-mitigations">
        <h2>Trade-offs and Self-coded Mitigations</h2>
        <p>
          Throughout the development process, certain trade-offs were made to balance security, usability, and accessibility. These trade-offs were carefully considered and will be discussed in detail during the video demonstration.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to utilizing pre-built security libraries, the development also includes self-coded mitigations to address specific security challenges. These self-coded solutions enhance the overall security of the movie blog system.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="testing-evaluation">
        <h2>Testing and Evaluation</h2>
        <p>
          The movie blog system has undergone thorough testing, including think-aloud user testing and system unit testing. Test plans were created to assess the effectiveness of each security mitigation and to ensure the platform's robustness.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          The Secure Movie Blog aims to provide a secure, user-friendly, and accessible platform for movie enthusiasts to share their passion and engage in meaningful discussions. By implementing comprehensive security measures and user-centric design principles, the blog system creates a safe and enjoyable environment for all users.
